# Research Interests and Focus Areas

This document is fictional and created for testing the LLM Tournament framework.

Primary Interests
- Field robotics for climate resilience and infrastructure monitoring
- Perception under adverse conditions (rain, fog, dust, low light)
- Robust state estimation and sensor fusion on embedded hardware
- Human-robot collaboration for emergency response

Secondary Interests
- Energy-efficient hardware and compute-aware model design
- Verification and testing for safety-critical robotics
- Data collection pipelines for low-resource environments

Preferred Working Style
- Hands-on prototyping with rapid iteration
- Close collaboration with end users (responders, utilities, city agencies)
- Research that results in deployable systems, not just simulations
