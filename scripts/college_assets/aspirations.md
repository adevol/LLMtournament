# Career Aspirations and Goals

This document is fictional and created for testing the LLM Tournament framework.

Short-Term Goals (Graduate Study)
- Build a strong foundation in robust autonomy, perception, and control for field robotics
- Develop research skills that connect algorithm design to hardware constraints
- Publish work on resilient robotic systems for disaster response and infrastructure monitoring

Medium-Term Goals (Early Career)
- Lead a small research team in a lab or applied R and D group
- Deploy at least one field-tested robotic system with a public agency or utility partner
- Contribute open-source tooling for safety validation in outdoor robotics

Long-Term Vision
- Create robotic systems that can be rapidly deployed after floods, storms, or earthquakes
- Reduce risk to first responders by automating dangerous inspection tasks
- Build partnerships between universities, cities, and industry to move research into practice

Questions That Motivate the Work
- How can we build autonomy that remains reliable in rain, dust, and poor GPS conditions?
- What sensor combinations yield the best robustness per dollar for field deployment?
- How do we design robots that are trusted by the people who rely on them during emergencies?
