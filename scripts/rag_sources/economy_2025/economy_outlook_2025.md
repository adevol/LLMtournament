# The 2025-2026 Economic Outlook

## Global Economic Shifts

The year 2025 marked a significant turning point in global economics. Fiscal and monetary stimulation policies across major economies, combined with substantial productivity gains, drove unprecedented market movements. The most notable trend was the significant shift in asset allocations away from US markets toward international alternatives.

## US Economic Policies

The Trump administration's domestic economic policies represented a levered bet on the power of capitalism to revitalize American manufacturing and enable American AI technology. Key policy changes included:

- Aggressively stimulative fiscal policy
- Reduced regulations to increase money and capital availability
- Raised tariffs to protect domestic producers and generate tax revenue
- Proactive supports to key industries' production

This represented a shift from free-market capitalism to government-directed capitalism.

## Inflation and Affordability

While those in the top 10% of wealth (capitalists with stock holdings) don't see inflation as a problem, the majority (bottom 60%) feel overwhelmed by it. The value of money issue, otherwise known as the affordability issue, became the number one political issue heading into 2026.

## Bond Markets

Regarding bonds and debt assets, because they are promises to deliver money, when the value of money goes down, their real worth is lowered even as their nominal prices rise. In 2025:

- 10-year US Treasury bonds returned 9% (roughly half from yield and half from price) in dollar terms
- Returns varied by currency: 9% in yen terms, 5% in renminbi terms, -4% in euro terms, -4% in Swiss franc terms, and -34% in gold terms
- Cash was an even worse investment

Foreign investors generally didn't like dollar bonds and cash unless they were currency hedged. The bond supply/demand imbalance presents challenges, with a large amount of debt (nearly $10 trillion) needing to be rolled forward.

## Future Outlook

At the same time, it appears likely the Fed will be inclined to ease to push real interest rates down. For these reasons, debt assets look unappealing, especially at the long end of the curve, and a further steepening of the yield curve seems probable.
