# Investment Strategy Considerations for 2026

## Current Market Positioning

Just about everything went up a lot in dollar terms because of big fiscal and monetary reflationary policies and is now relatively expensive.

## Illiquid Markets Challenges

The reflationary moves didn't help venture capital, private equity, and real estate - the illiquid markets - very much. These markets are having problems:

- If one believes the stated valuations in VC and PE (which most people don't), liquidity premiums are now very low
- These premiums are likely to rise a lot as debt these entities took on has to be financed at higher interest rates
- Pressures to raise liquidity are building
- This would make illiquid investments fall relative to liquid ones

## Fed Policy Outlook

It appears most likely that the newly appointed Fed chair and the FOMC will be biased to push nominal and real interest rates down, which would:
- Be supportive to prices
- Inflate bubbles

## Productivity Growth Uncertainties

Productivity growth will likely improve in 2026, but uncertainties remain:

1. How much productivity will actually improve
2. How much will flow to company profits and stock prices (benefiting capitalist owners)
3. How much will go to workers in compensation changes and taxes (the classic political right/left question)

## Political Risk

The fight between hard right and hard left is brewing - a fight over wealth and money that will likely affect markets and economies.

Key considerations:
- President Trump has a two-year unimpeded mandate that can be weakened in 2026 mid-term elections
- It's becoming a norm in developed countries to see populist politicians who advocate for extreme policies, fail to deliver, and are thrown out
- These frequent changes from one extreme to another are destabilizing

## Investment Positioning Advice

Rather than following specific position advice, investors should:
1. Develop the ability to make investment decisions independently
2. Either place your own bets on which markets will do well and poorly
3. Or build a great strategic asset allocation mix and stick with it
4. Or pick managers who will invest well for you
