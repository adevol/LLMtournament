# Dollar Devaluation and Currency Movements in 2025

## The Weakening Dollar

In 2025, the US dollar experienced significant depreciation against major currencies and alternative stores of value:

- Dollar fell 0.3% against the Japanese yen
- Dollar fell 4% against the Chinese renminbi
- Dollar fell 12% against the euro
- Dollar fell 13% against the Swiss franc
- Dollar fell 39% against gold (the second largest reserve currency and only major non-fiat currency)

## Key Principles

When one's own currency goes down, it makes things measured in it appear to have gone up. Looking at investment returns through the lens of a weak currency makes them look stronger than they really are.

### S&P 500 Returns by Currency Perspective

The S&P 500 returned:
- 18% for a dollar-based investor
- 17% for a yen-based investor
- 13% for a renminbi-based investor
- Only 4% for a euro-based investor
- Only 3% for a Swiss franc-based investor
- NEGATIVE 28% for a gold-based investor

## Economic Implications of Currency Decline

When one's currency goes down:
1. It reduces one's wealth and buying power
2. It makes one's goods and services cheaper in others' currencies
3. It makes others' goods and services more expensive in one's own currency

These effects influence inflation rates and trade patterns, though with a lag.

## Currency Hedging Considerations

Whether or not you are currency hedged matters significantly. If you don't have and don't want to take a view on the currency, the recommended approach is to always be hedged to your least-risk currency mix and make tactical moves from there if capable.

## Gold as the Premier Store of Value

All fiat currencies fell in 2025. The biggest story and market moves were the result of the weakest fiat currencies falling the most, while the strongest/hardest currencies strengthened the most.

Gold was the best major investment of the year, returning 65% in dollar terms, outperforming the S&P index (18% in dollars) by 47 percentage points.
