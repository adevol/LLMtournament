# Geopolitics and Technology Forces Shaping 2025-2026

## Shifting World Order

In 2025, there was a clear shift from multilateralism (operating by rules overseen by multilateral organizations) to unilateralism (power rules and countries operate in their self-interest).

### Consequences of This Shift:
- Raised threats of conflict
- Increased military spending and borrowing to finance it in most countries
- Increased use of economic threats and sanctions
- Rise in protectionism
- Deglobalization trends
- More investment and business deals
- More foreign capital promised to be invested in the United States
- Strengthening demand for gold
- Reduced foreign demand for US debt, dollars, and other assets

## Foreign Policy Impact

The Trump administration's foreign policy scared and turned off some foreign investors, as fears of sanctions and conflicts supported portfolio diversification and buying of gold.

## The AI Factor

The AI boom is now in the early stages of a bubble, having a big effect on everything. Key considerations:

- AI technology is enabling productivity gains
- Technology is being cited as a driver of margin improvements in corporations
- The Magnificent 7 tech stocks account for about a third of S&P 500 market cap
- Companies are under pressure regarding how much AI productivity gains flow to profits vs workers

## Climate and Nature

The progression of climate change continued while there was a politically led Trump shift in spending money and encouraging energy production in an attempt to minimize the issue.

## The Big Cycle Framework

The following forces will continue to be major drivers:
1. Debt/money/markets/economy dynamics
2. Domestic political forces
3. Geopolitical forces (e.g., increased military spending)
4. Force of nature (climate)
5. Force of new technologies (e.g., AI costs and benefits)

These forces broadly track the Big Cycle template of how countries rise and decline.
