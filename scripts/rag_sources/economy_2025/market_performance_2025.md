# Global Market Performance 2025

## US Stock Underperformance

While US stocks were strong in dollar terms (S&P 500 returned 18%), they were much less strong in currencies that were strong, and they significantly underperformed other countries' equities.

### Outperformance vs US Stocks:
- European stocks outperformed US stocks by 23%
- Chinese stocks outperformed by 21%
- UK stocks outperformed by 19%
- Japanese stocks outperformed by 10%

### Emerging Markets
- Emerging market stocks returned 34%
- Emerging market dollar debt returned 14%
- Emerging market local currency debt in dollar terms returned 18%

## Implications

There were big shifts in flows, values, and wealth away from the US. What is happening will probably lead to more rebalancing and diversifying globally.

## US Stock Market Analysis

The strong US results were due to both strong earnings growth and P/E expansion:

- Earnings were up 12% in dollar terms
- P/E rose by about 5%
- Dividend yield was about 1%
- Total S&P return: approximately 18% in dollars

### Magnificent 7 vs The Rest
- "Magnificent 7" stocks (about 1/3 of S&P 500 market cap): 22% earnings growth
- Other 493 stocks in S&P: 9% earnings growth
- Combined S&P 500 index: 12% earnings growth

### Sources of Earnings Growth
- Sales increased by 7%
- Margins increased by 5.3%
- Sales were responsible for 57% of the earnings increase
- Margin improvements were responsible for 43%

Some significant portion of margin improvements appears to be due to technology efficiencies.

## Valuation Concerns

With PE multiples high and credit spreads low, valuations appear stretched. If history is a guide, this portends low future equity returns.

Expected returns based on stock and bond yields using normal productivity growth:
- Long-term equity expected return: approximately 4.7% (sub-10th percentile reading)
- Existing bond returns: approximately 4.9%
- Equity risk premiums are low

Credit spreads contracted to very low levels in 2025, which was positive for lower credit and equity assets but leaves these spreads less likely to decline and more likely to rise.

## Risk Assessment

There isn't much more return that can be squeezed out of equity risk premiums, credit spreads, and liquidity premiums. If interest rates rise (possible due to supply/demand pressures), it will have a large negative effect on credit and stock markets.
